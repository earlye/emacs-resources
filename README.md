A set of emacs utilities. This is intended to replace your entire
.emacs.d directory, because, well, it's my entire .emacs.d
directory. Don't want to do that? Well, you could always fork and
modify to your content. ;-)

Installation:

In a terminal:
```bash
git clone -r {url} ~/.emacs.d
```

In your ~/.emacs file:
```lisp
(load "~/.emacs.d/dotemacs")
```

That's it!
